Project: EdgeAI EV Charger Monitor Demo (FRDM-MCXN947)

State: initialized
- Standalone project scaffold created.
- GitHub remote configured at `origin` and `main` pushed.
- Build/flash workflow scripts and MCUX SDK overlay are in place.
- Firmware source currently provides baseline console bring-up.
- Added cockpit-style gauge theme preset (`cockpit_dark_v1`) and documentation.
- Added replay/live-override data source abstraction for gauge testing.
- Added CSV-to-header conversion flow for editable test traces.
- Added first on-screen cockpit dashboard render (rings, needles, digital readouts).
- Build+flash validated using shared workspace path override.
- Render loop cadence bug fixed and reflashed (blank-screen mitigation).
- LCD init path fixed (`BOARD_InitHardware`) and UART now reports `Gauge render: ready`.
- Reduced raster flicker by avoiding full-screen redraw each frame (dynamic-region redraw only).
- Gauge/text overlap fixed and dynamic updates now use per-value/per-needle incremental redraw.
- Added real-data capture pipeline scripts for MCUX energy tooling and replay conversion.
- Added synthetic 5-minute EV charging telemetry dataset with labeled anomaly windows.
- Synthetic EV dataset updated to 20 Hz sampling (6000 rows over 5 minutes).
- Dashboard UI upgraded to a professional cockpit-style cluster layout (center + dual side gauges).
- Added oscilloscope panel (upper-right) with white/red timelines and yellow 20 Hz signal trace labeling.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after style update.
- LCD layout now uses 3 vertical quadrants with gauge cluster in left/middle and scope + status terminal in right quadrant.
- Added lower-right text terminal block showing CPU usage, AI status, mode, temp, SOC, current, and power.
- Rebuilt and reflashed firmware after quadrant layout update.
