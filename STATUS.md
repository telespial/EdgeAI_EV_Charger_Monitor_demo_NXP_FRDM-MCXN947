Project: EdgeAI EV Charger Monitor Demo (FRDM-MCXN947)

State: initialized
- Standalone project scaffold created.
- GitHub remote configured at `origin` and `main` pushed.
- Build/flash workflow scripts and MCUX SDK overlay are in place.
- Firmware source currently provides baseline console bring-up.
- Added cockpit-style gauge theme preset (`cockpit_dark_v1`) and documentation.
- Added replay/live-override data source abstraction for gauge testing.
- Added CSV-to-header conversion flow for editable test traces.
- Added first on-screen cockpit dashboard render (rings, needles, digital readouts).
- Build+flash validated using shared workspace path override.
- Render loop cadence bug fixed and reflashed (blank-screen mitigation).
- LCD init path fixed (`BOARD_InitHardware`) and UART now reports `Gauge render: ready`.
- Reduced raster flicker by avoiding full-screen redraw each frame (dynamic-region redraw only).
- Gauge/text overlap fixed and dynamic updates now use per-value/per-needle incremental redraw.
- Added real-data capture pipeline scripts for MCUX energy tooling and replay conversion.
- Added synthetic 5-minute EV charging telemetry dataset with labeled anomaly windows.
- Synthetic EV dataset updated to 20 Hz sampling (6000 rows over 5 minutes).
- Dashboard UI upgraded to a professional cockpit-style cluster layout (center + dual side gauges).
- Added oscilloscope panel (upper-right) with white/red timelines and yellow 20 Hz signal trace labeling.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after style update.
- LCD layout now uses 3 vertical quadrants with gauge cluster in left/middle and scope + status terminal in right quadrant.
- Added lower-right text terminal block showing CPU usage, AI status, mode, temp, SOC, current, and power.
- Rebuilt and reflashed firmware after quadrant layout update.
- Scope colors updated to red/white/green with yellow bottom title `NXP EDGE AI`.
- Added font glyph `X` for dashboard title rendering.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after scope style update.
- Gauge visuals rethemed to red/black performance-cluster style with central red dial and white/red scale accents.
- Scope/terminal borders now align with red-accent cockpit palette.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after gauge style update.
- Dashboard text updated: bottom large yellow `NXP EDGEAI`, center `EV AI` removed, top header changed to `(c)RICHARD HABERKERN`.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after text update.
- Moved right-side small gauge into the first section so both small gauges are now grouped together in the left segment.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after gauge relocation.
- Bottom `NXP EDGEAI` text now centered to the overall LCD panel center.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after global-center text alignment update.
- Added battery charging level indicator above the main gauge, driven by SOC.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after battery indicator addition.
- Gauge hash marks and needle sweep paths now follow proper arc geometry (triangular sweep removed).
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after arc LUT update.
- Gauge hashmark dots now render inside the circular lines (inward radius offset applied).
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after tick-radius adjustment.
- Removed main-gauge `SPEED` text and SOC data bar/text display.
- Battery indicator remains as SOC visualization above main gauge.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after label/SOC display removal.
- Removed three red hash lines from main gauge styling.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after redline-stroke removal.
- Large gauge value text now centers dynamically in the main gauge.
- `POWER` label moved lower, beneath the lower small gauge.
- Increased space between small gauges (position and radius adjustments).
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after layout refinements.
- Centered main numeric text in large gauge.
- Moved `POWER` label beneath lower small gauge.
- Increased vertical spacing between small gauges and reduced small-gauge size.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after layout adjustment.
- Lower-left horizontal guide line segments shortened to avoid lower gauge/`POWER` text overlap.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after line-length adjustment.
