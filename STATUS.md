Project: EdgeAI EV Charger Monitor Demo (FRDM-MCXN947)

State: initialized
- Standalone project scaffold created.
- GitHub remote configured at `origin` and `main` pushed.

- Build+flash validated using shared workspace path override.
- Render loop cadence bug fixed and reflashed (blank-screen mitigation).
- LCD init path fixed (`BOARD_InitHardware`) and UART now reports `Gauge render: ready`.
- Reduced raster flicker by avoiding full-screen redraw each frame (dynamic-region redraw only).
- Gauge/text overlap fixed and dynamic updates now use per-value/per-needle incremental redraw.

- Added synthetic 5-minute EV charging telemetry dataset with labeled anomaly windows.
- Synthetic EV dataset updated to 20 Hz sampling (6000 rows over 5 minutes).

- Added oscilloscope panel (upper-right) with white/red timelines and yellow 20 Hz signal trace labeling.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after style update.
- LCD layout now uses 3 vertical quadrants with gauge cluster in left/middle and scope + status terminal in right quadrant.
- Added lower-right text terminal block showing CPU usage, AI status, mode, temp, SOC, current, and power.

- Scope colors updated to red/white/green with yellow bottom title `NXP EDGE AI`.
- Added font glyph `X` for dashboard title rendering.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after scope style update.
- Gauge visuals rethemed to red/black performance-cluster style with central red dial and white/red scale accents.
- Scope/terminal borders now align with red-accent cockpit palette.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after gauge style update.
- Dashboard text updated: bottom large yellow `NXP EDGEAI`, center `EV AI` removed, top header changed to `(c)RICHARD HABERKERN`.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after text update.
- Moved right-side small gauge into the first section so both small gauges are now grouped together in the left segment.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after gauge relocation.
- Bottom `NXP EDGEAI` text now centered to the overall LCD panel center.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after global-center text alignment update.
- Added battery charging level indicator above the main gauge, driven by SOC.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after battery indicator addition.
- Gauge hash marks and needle sweep paths now follow proper arc geometry (triangular sweep removed).
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after arc LUT update.
- Gauge hashmark dots now render inside the circular lines (inward radius offset applied).
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after tick-radius adjustment.
- Removed main-gauge `SPEED` text and SOC data bar/text display.
- Battery indicator remains as SOC visualization above main gauge.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after label/SOC display removal.
- Removed three red hash lines from main gauge styling.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after redline-stroke removal.
- Large gauge value text now centers dynamically in the main gauge.
- `POWER` label moved lower, beneath the lower small gauge.
- Increased space between small gauges (position and radius adjustments).
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after layout refinements.
- Centered main numeric text in large gauge.
- Moved `POWER` label beneath lower small gauge.
- Increased vertical spacing between small gauges and reduced small-gauge size.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after layout adjustment.
- Lower-left horizontal guide line segments shortened to avoid lower gauge/`POWER` text overlap.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after line-length adjustment.
- `CURRENT` label moved below upper gauge at the same relative distance as `POWER` below lower gauge.
- Added corresponding upper horizontal guide line to match lower `POWER` treatment.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after label/line symmetry update.
- `CURRENT` label moved farther down below upper gauge to avoid overlap.
- Matching upper horizontal line shifted downward to align with updated label placement.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after upper-label/line reposition.
- Adjusted `CURRENT` label and upper short horizontal line to eliminate overlap with gauge/text.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after CURRENT/line cleanup.
- Left vertical guide moved left for more gauge spacing.
- `CURRENT` text aligned with its short horizontal line using same offset pattern as `POWER`.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after guide/text alignment update.
- Added large `A` and `W` unit letters inside small gauges for amps/watts visual context.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after unit-letter overlay addition.
- Added extreme-left green vertical bar ending at the white guide line.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after left accent bar addition.
- Left guide line moved outward to increase gap from gauges.
- `CURRENT` text aligned to match short-guide/label relationship used by `POWER`.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after spacing/alignment refinement.
- Small-gauge pointers shortened to match the reduced pointer style used on the center gauge.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after small-gauge pointer-length update.
- Large gauge center changed to yellow base fill (backmost center layer).
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after yellow-center update.
- Large gauge center yellow changed to a very dark yellow tone.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after dark-yellow center update.
- Large gauge center dark-yellow tone reduced further for a deeper look.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after darker center update.
- Left vertical green box converted into a live segmented bargraph.
- Bargraph level now updates from current draw with green/yellow/red bands.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after bargraph update.
- Left vertical bargraph now tracks temperature rather than current.
- Added red over-temp state (`temp_c >= 70`) and bottom readout `TEMP: XXC` below the lower horizontal line.
- Firmware rebuilt and reflashed after temp-bargraph wiring update.
- Added real telemetry mode (`real_telemetry`) using onboard OPAMP + LPADC with startup zero calibration.
- `power_data_source` now auto-selects real telemetry when available and falls back to replay otherwise.
- Main loop now emits 20 Hz structured UART telemetry lines (`TELEM_CSV,...`) for host capture.
- Added `tools/capture_uart_telemetry.sh` to capture firmware telemetry into CSV from `/dev/ttyACM*`.
- Firmware build completed successfully for `build_ev_charger_try3`.
- Flash attempt failed on current LinkServer/probe session with MEM-AP target-connect error (image built, not confirmed flashed).
- Added EV charging profile generator `tools/generate_ev_charge_profiles.py`.
- Generated 12-minute/20 Hz datasets with 12-hour-equivalent timeline:
  - `data/ev_charge_12min_normal_20hz.csv`
  - `data/ev_charge_12min_wear_20hz.csv`
  - `data/ev_charge_12min_fault_20hz.csv`
- Rebuilt replay source to wear profile and regenerated `src/replay_trace_generated.h`.
- Added elapsed charge clock and connector-wear/anomaly AI fields into runtime sample model.
- Updated dashboard:
  - elapsed clock inside center gauge
  - center-gauge yellow tuning
  - centered elapsed block in second section
  - noisy oscilloscope traces
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully (multiple UI refinements).
- Created golden + failsafe restore point:
  - `GOLDEN_20260214_203015`
  - `GOLDEN_LOCK_20260214_203015_22b87ce`
