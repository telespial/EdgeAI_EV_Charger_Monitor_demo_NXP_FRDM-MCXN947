- Normal-state status box requirement applied: `SYSTEM STABLE` should be solid green; only warning/fault should flash.
- 2026-02-15 build attempt failed during CMake configure:
  - `./tools/build_frdmmcxn947.sh debug`
  - Error: `mcux_set_variable` incorrect arguments in `mcuxsdk/middleware/edgefast_bluetooth/CMakeLists.txt`
- 2026-02-15 build path repaired:
  - build script now force-reinstalls project overlay into workspace examples each run
  - patch script now guards missing `middleware/eiq/mpp` CMake include
  - `./tools/build_frdmmcxn947.sh debug` succeeds and emits fresh `.bin`
- 2026-02-15 AI toggle debug/fix pass:
  - removed INT-edge forced-toggle fallback that caused unreliable toggles
  - AI toggle now requires a validated new press mapped into AI-pill hitbox
  - added UART touch diagnostics (`TOUCH_PRESS`, `TOUCH_HOLD`, `TOUCH_INT_EDGE`) for hardware calibration/debug
- 2026-02-15 flashed latest built image to FRDM-MCXN947 via `./tools/flash_frdmmcxn947.sh` (LinkServer probe `#1`).
- 2026-02-15 touchscreen AI-pill fix pass (hardware control + mapping):
  - GT911 INT pin callback now drives GPIO output levels for init/address mode.
  - GT911 reset callback now drives reset GPIO (was previously no-op).
  - Touch hit-test now maps from raw GT911 coordinates into LCD space before AI-pill matching.
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully after this touch fix.
- 2026-02-15 fallback touch response added:
  - if touch INT edge occurs without a coordinate packet, AI toggle can still trigger via controlled fallback path (`src=touch_int_edge`)
  - coordinate-based hit testing remains enabled and preferred.
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully after fallback-touch update.
- 2026-02-15 touch behavior aligned with 3D-printer ToF demo implementation:
  - same GT911 coordinate transform style
  - same pressed-edge gating (`pressed && !was_down`) and periodic touch polling pattern
  - removed INT-edge fallback toggle path to eliminate random/intermittent triggers
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully after this port.
- 2026-02-15 option 2 enabled:
  - static/touch-priority UI mode active (no continuous sample-driven full gauge refresh)
  - button polling remains active; redraws now happen on AI toggle transitions
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully with option-2 firmware.
- 2026-02-15 AI touchbutton layout update:
  - moved button to centered top of display
  - increased button size substantially for easier tapping
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully with enlarged centered button.
- 2026-02-15 touch-debug test app deployed:
  - `src/edgeai_ev_charger_monitor_demo.c` now runs a minimal screen with only one AI ON/OFF touch button.
  - Button is centered; no gauges or other widgets are drawn.
  - Touch handling is polled continuously in the loop and indicator redraw is triggered on valid touch-down toggle.
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully to FRDM-MCXN947 (LinkServer probe `#1`).
- 2026-02-15 reflashed the same touch-only test image for repeat hardware verification.
- Flash succeeded via `./tools/flash_frdmmcxn947.sh` on LinkServer probe `#1`.
- 2026-02-15 touch-read path aligned to known-good 3D-printer GT911 callback model:
  - `TouchConfigIntPin()` now enables `PORT4` clock and applies pull-mode config only.
  - `TouchConfigResetPin()` now matches known-good no-op reset callback behavior.
- Added press-edge UART diagnostics to isolate mapping vs no-read conditions:
  - `TOUCH_DOWN,<x>,<y>,IN_BUTTON|OUTSIDE_BUTTON`
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully after touch callback + diagnostics update.
- 2026-02-15 GT911 init path further aligned to known-good ToF firmware:

  - LCD init and first button draw now occur before touch init.
  - touch init runs after UI is visible.
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully after LCD-first startup change.
- 2026-02-15 touch-reset signal ownership cleanup:
  - removed remaining touch reset pin constants/assumptions tied to `P4_7`

  - kept GT911 reset callback as no-op with explicit note that `P4_7` is LCD reset (`LCD_RST`) per module MRD
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully after touch-reset cleanup.
- 2026-02-15 any-touch diagnostic mode enabled:
  - AI ON/OFF now toggles on any detected touch-down edge (hitbox bypassed intentionally)
  - UART logs still report touch coordinates and `src=any_touch`
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully after any-touch diagnostic update.
- 2026-02-15 board-init parity fix from ToF project:
  - `cm33_core0/hardware_init.c` now configures Arduino I2C FLEXCOMM2 clock path.
  - Added:
    - `CLOCK_SetClkDiv(kCLOCK_DivFlexcom2Clk, 1u);`
    - `CLOCK_AttachClk(kFRO12M_to_FLEXCOMM2);`
  - GT911 uses `LPI2C2` (FC2), so this clock path is required.
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully after FC2 hardware-init fix.
- 2026-02-15 added explicit FC2/LPI2C2 master bring-up in touch test app:
  - `src/edgeai_ev_charger_monitor_demo.c` now initializes `LPI2C2` at 400 kHz before `GT911_Init`.
  - This mirrors ToF runtime dependency where FC2 I2C is brought up by TMF8828 stack before touch init.
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully after explicit LPI2C2 init addition.
- 2026-02-15 diagnostic cleanup:
  - removed temporary any-touch toggle mode
  - restored normal toggle behavior: press-edge must occur inside button bounds
  - kept FC2 clock + explicit LPI2C2 init fixes in place
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully after cleanup.
- 2026-02-15 EV dashboard reintegration:
  - replaced touch-only test app loop with full dashboard runtime (`PowerData` + `GaugeRender`)
  - AI touchbutton now operates against dashboard AI-pill bounds from `gauge_render.h`
  - touch polling remains GT911 over FC2/LPI2C2 with press-edge toggle behavior

  - added missing uppercase `Y` glyph to text renderer so normal text displays fully
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully after minor-issue fixes.
- 2026-02-15 AI-off status and decimal rendering fixes:
  - when AI is OFF, status now uses direct temp/voltage/current overage rules (normal/warning/fault) instead of blank/RAW behavior
  - alert box and terminal `SYS` line both reflect that non-AI rule status path
  - added decimal-point glyph (`.`) to bitmap font so current values render as `37.3` rather than `37  3`
- Rebuilt and reflashed successfully after AI-off status + decimal fixes.
- 2026-02-15 replay realism and long-window trend update:
